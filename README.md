### Coding Kata: Even Fibonacci  

Here's a potential interview question from Project Euler that will help you learn to break problems down into smaller steps. Ever heard of Fibonacci numbers?

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Project Euler No. 2
You read that right: 4 million. You'll want to break this problem down a little, I think.

You must be able to print the answer to the console.

### Coding Kata: 3s and 5s

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Coding Kata: FizzBuzz

Ah, FizzBuzz. This is one of the most popular interview questions. And surprisingly, most developers fail it. Well, you won't, because you're doing it in Week 3.

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."
